# Seizure Detection using EEG Signals

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Seizure Detection using EEG Signals" project repository. 
This project focuses on the automated detection of seizure states utilizing EEG (Electroencephalography) signals. 
The primary objective is to develop a robust system that can accurately identify instances of seizure activity within EEG data, 
aiding in timely medical intervention and patient care.

## Background

Seizure detection plays a crucial role in managing epilepsy and other neurological disorders. 
EEG signals, which record the brain's electrical activity, offer valuable insights into these conditions. 
This project employs advanced machine learning techniques to identify distinct EEG patterns associated with seizure occurrences, 
contributing to accurate and timely diagnosis.
