## Fish Feeding System 
A controlled **fish-feeding system** is very essential for fish in local area ponds, rivers, etc. 
With this controlled system fish can have food from time to time for their healthy survival.

We could able to design a model for the same by taking into account cost-effective technology and **prototyped** the design.
We not only design the system for the time interval of food distribution but also took into consideration fish health too, such as 
monitoring water quality.
