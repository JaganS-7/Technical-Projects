## Introduction

The ability to recognize and classify handwritten characters is a fundamental task in the field of image recognition and artificial intelligence. This repository showcases a CNN-based solution for achieving accurate handwritten character recognition. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled handwritten characters and is capable of predicting the alphabet corresponding to an input image.

### Prerequisites

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (cv2)
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Usage
This project demonstrates the entire process of creating, training, and evaluating the CNN model for handwritten character recognition. It includes visualizations that help you understand the model's behavior and performance. You can also use a custom image to test the model's prediction capabilities

## Model Overview
The CNN model architecture is designed to efficiently capture features from handwritten character images. It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract and downsample features. The model also includes fully connected layers for classification and an output layer with a softmax activation function.

## Results
The script displays the training progress over epochs, showing accuracy and loss values for both training and testing datasets. The accuracy of the model on the testing dataset indicates its performance in correctly classifying unseen data.

## Custom Image Prediction
This project also provides an option to test the model on a custom image. By providing an image file, you can observe how the model predicts the alphabet corresponding to the provided image.
